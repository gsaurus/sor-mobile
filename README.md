# Streets of Rage Mobile

A reverse enginneered version of Bare Knuckle Mobile, translated to English and with improved gameplay features.


Bare Knuckle Mobile (ベアナックル モバイル) is a beat 'em up game released by Sega for Windows Mobile smartphones in 2008. Only available for subscribers in Japan, the game is essentially a remake of the original Streets of Rage, with redrawn graphics (mostly based on Streets of Rage 2), as well as new sounds effects and musical arrangements.

You must own the original game in order to provide the necessary art assets to execute the code.
